# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

# If you get a bunch of dependency errors try running
# `gem uninstall -aIx` then `bundle install`
# (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57236495/bundle-exec-jekyll-serve-dependency-error-yikes-it-looks-like-you-dont-have)

# The 'github-pages' gem has a dependency on the 'unf' gem.
# If bundle fails to install the 'github-pages' gem, 
# try running `gem install unf`.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

# gem "rails"
# gem "jekyll" # This isn't needed if using 'github-pages' above
gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
gem 'jekyll-include-cache'

# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:
#   gem "jekyll-paginate"
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap"
#   gem "jekyll-gist"
#   gem "jekyll-feed"
#   gem "jekyll-include-cache"
#
# If you have any other plugins, put them here!
