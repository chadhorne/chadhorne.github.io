I'm Chad Horne. I'm a senior data engineer at [Henderson Engineers](https://www.hendersonengineers.com/), a national building systems design firm. I design and build data analytics infrastructure with a focus on high performance data warehouse systems and data lakes. I am responsible for building and maintaining the [Data Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_vault_modeling) architecture for our enterprise data platform, as well as spearheading innovative initiatives to improve the overall data ecosystem at Henderson. Most of my work revolves around [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and open-source frameworks, however I have extensive experience working with a variety of different data tools. Throughout my career I've worked with a wide range of different organizations, from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies, and I'm always looking for new ways to solve problems with data.
