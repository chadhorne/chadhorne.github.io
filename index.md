I'm Chad Horne. I'm a senior data engineer and cloud data consultant. I analyze data architectures and technical infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce complexity of different types of data systems. My current work is focused on the [Azure Cloud Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), however I have extensive experience working with other data tools and on-premises data systems as well. I've worked with a wide range of different organizations, from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies, and I'm always excited to use my skills to find the best ways to manage data.
