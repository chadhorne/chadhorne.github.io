I'm Chad Horne. I'm a senior data engineer and cloud data consultant. I design, build, and maintain data architectures and infrastructure with the goal of maximizing efficiency while reducing complexity. My current work is focused on the Azure Cloud Platform and Databricks, however I have extensive experience working with other data tools and on-premises data systems as well. I've worked with a wide range of different organizations, from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies, and I'm always looking for new ways to solve problems with data.
