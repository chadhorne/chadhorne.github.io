I've finally got my website put together! In the coming weeks I'll be tweaking things and working out the kinks still, so expect changes. I may even get around to making more blog posts.

P.S. I built this website using [Jekyll][jekyll]. It has some pretty handy features for building websites, including LOTS of existing themes to choose from. And it's supported by [GitHub Pages][github-pages] as well. Definitely worth checking out if you already manage a website of your own.
