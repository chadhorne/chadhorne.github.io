I finally got my website put together! In the coming weeks I'll be tweaking things and working out the kinks still, so expect changes.

Also I built this website using [Jekyll][https://jekyllrb.com/] and it has some pretty handy features for building websites, including LOTS of existing themes to choose from. Definitely worth checking out if you already manage a website of your own.
